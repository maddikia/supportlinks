# supportlinks

## what is supportlinks?
a fully anonymous, youth-focused support chatbot providing mental health resources and connecting users to peer support

## get linked
* express yourself anonymously & get **link**ed to mental health resources
* form support **link**s with experienced peers in our volunteer network
* get **link**ed to local hospitals in times of crisis or injury
* un**link** yourself from mental illness and **link** yourself to a healthy mind

## what we offer
the basis of our platform is **link** (they/them), a **natural language understanding chatbot**. they’ve been trained to recognize depression, suicidal tendencies, stress, anxiety, and some eating disorders. by sharing what you’re feeling with a link, they’ll provide you with student-centered resources to seek help and make strides towards a healthy mind. if you’re in crisis, in danger, or harmed, they will connect you to hospitals in your area. link can also introduce you to our peer network. beyond connecting you with external resources, we can link you to other students with similar experiences through our **peer support network**. 

## why it's relevant
it is estimated that 13–20% of youth living in the United States experience a mental disorder in a given year ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/features/kf-childrens-mental-health-report.html)). the pandemic certainly hasn't helped, and 56.2% of young adults (ages 18-24) now report symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorder ([source](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/)). youth's mental state is deteriorating, and we need resources for youth well-being now more than ever. 

## how we built it
We built link, our favorite chatbot, using Google Cloud’s **Dialogflow**, with all interactions implemented as intents. In cases of injury and crisis, we connected link with the **public [Hospital General Information dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/hhs/hospital-general-information?project=peppy-tiger-268215)** using **BigQuery API**. Our website was built using **HTML/CSS/JS** and logo was custom-designed.
